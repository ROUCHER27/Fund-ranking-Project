# Automated Ranking and Reporting System for Chinese Currency Market Fund Products

## Project Overview

This project leverages Python to independently develop an automated ranking system for Chinese currency market fund products and an automated workflow for fund manager product research reports and reporting. It is designed to streamline the workflow, improve data accuracy, and enhance reporting efficiency.

## Key Features

- **API Data Acquisition:**  
  Utilizes the Wind financial terminal API to efficiently acquire and process over 3,500 currency and bond fund product datasets. Demonstrates proficiency in both Python and Excel API interfaces for automated data retrieval.

- **Independent Python Scripting:**  
  Developed Python scripts using Numpy and Pandas to monitor and process more than ten key performance indicators in real time (including annual/monthly/daily returns, fund type, NAV, maximum drawdown, etc.). Automated ranking of target fund products, with results output to Excel for visualization. The system processes over 100,000 data points and selects the top 20% of products, providing robust data support for investment decision-making and product research.

- **Automated Report Generation:**  
  Independently completed and automated the creation of over 20 fund manager roadshow research reports. Developed Python scripts to generate and format research reports, and built an automated template to export reports as Word documents. This process reduced research report preparation time by approximately 80% and facilitated efficient public communication.

- **Official Account Upload:**  
  After thorough review, the finalized fund manager reports are formatted and uploaded to the company’s official WeChat public account, ensuring accuracy and consistency for external dissemination.
